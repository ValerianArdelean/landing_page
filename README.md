# Single page application

### Overview
* This is a single page HTML&CSS + JavaScript app

* It is my second project for the Udacity ```Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program```

* The app main goal is to demonstrate student capability to manipulate the DOM, by creating a dynamically Navigation menu that could expand for as many sections are need it or they could be dynamically added also.
  In our case, the sections and content were hard coded in HTML file.
* Also, the section actively being viewed in the app is highlighted in the Navigation menu. And when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scroll user to the appropriate section, rather than giving the default jump.
